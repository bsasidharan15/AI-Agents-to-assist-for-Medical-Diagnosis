# 🧠 AI-Agents-to-assist-for-Medical-Diagnosis

An interactive Streamlit-based medical assistant powered by domain-specific AI agents. This tool allows healthcare professionals and researchers to analyze medical reports using simulated specialists (Cardiologist, Psychologist, Pulmonologist) and generate comprehensive diagnostic insights. It runs locally using the Mistral LLM via the Ollama backend.

## 📌 Features

- 🔬 **Specialist Simulations**: Analyze reports from the perspective of a cardiologist, psychologist, or pulmonologist using dedicated prompts.
- 🎛️ **Manual Agent Selection**: Choose a specialist or run a full multidisciplinary analysis via the frontend interface.
- 🧠 **Multidisciplinary Team Analysis**: Combines all three specialist reports to suggest three possible diagnoses with reasoning.
- 📤 **File Upload & Analysis**: Upload `.txt` medical reports for instant processing and evaluation.
- 💾 **Report Export**: Final diagnosis is saved to `results/final_diagnosis.txt` for record-keeping.
- 🛠️ **Local LLM Integration**: Uses `mistral-nemo:latest` model via `langchain_ollama` for privacy-respecting, offline AI inference.
